            <h2>Look, I'm Not a Bible Scholar</h2>
            <p>
                Let me just get that out there first. I don't have a theology degree. I don't go to church every Sunday.
                In fact, I don't go to church often at all. I'm not here to preach to you or tell you how to live your life.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm just a guy from an Irish Catholic family who went to Irish Catholic school my whole life.
                My parents raised me in the faith. I sat through Mass, memorized prayers, learned the stories.
                And somehow, despite all the years since then, I think it impacted me more than I realized.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't claim to know the Bible inside and out. Honestly? <span class="casual">I don't know that much about it.</span>
                But I know enough to see something that most people miss.
            </p>

            <div class="pullquote">
                Most people see the Bible as that stupid old silly book sitting in a hotel room that nobody reads.
                <br><br>
                I see it as the only weapon given to us by God.
            </div>

            <h2>Things I Can't Explain</h2>
            <p>
                I've experienced things in my life that I can't explain. Things that have nothing to do with this project,
                but everything to do with why I believe the Lord has been there for me.
            </p>
            <p>
                I can't prove it. I don't have a burning bush story or a dramatic conversion moment. But I've felt
                something—protection, guidance, grace—in ways that don't make logical sense. And I think that's
                part of what faith is. Not knowing everything, but knowing enough.
            </p>
            <p>
                I try to live the way I think Christ would want me to live. Not perfectly. Not even close. But I try.
                And part of that is seeing this Book—not as rules and religion—but as something <em>powerful</em>.
            </p>

            <div class="divider">✦ ✦ ✦</div>

            <h2>Why I Built This</h2>
            <p>
                Here's the thing about the Bible that most people don't realize: it's not just a collection of random stories.
                It's <span class="highlight">interconnected</span>. Every book, every chapter, every verse points to something else.
                Genesis echoes in Revelation. The Prophets foreshadow the Gospels. It's all woven together.
            </p>
            <p>
                And I thought: What if people could <em>see</em> that? Not just read about it, but actually
                <span class="casual">visualize</span> how it all connects?
            </p>
            <p>
                So I started coding. Not because I'm some expert. Not because I have all the answers. But because
                I wanted to show people what I was seeing. Maybe if they could see it too, they'd understand
                why this Book isn't just some relic from ancient history.
            </p>

            <div class="pullquote">
                This isn't about religion. It's about seeing the pattern. The design. The weapon.
            </div>

            <h2>The Data Doesn't Lie</h2>
            <p>
                I found this dataset—the Treasury of Scripture Knowledge. It's public domain, compiled by scholars
                over centuries. <span class="stats-inline">Over 340,000 cross-references</span> mapping how verses
                connect to each other across the entire Bible.
            </p>
            <p>
                And when you look at it—when you actually <em>visualize</em> it—you see the pattern. You see how
                Genesis chapter 3 connects to Romans chapter 5. How Isaiah's prophecies thread through the Gospels.
                How Revelation mirrors the Exodus.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's not random. It's not coincidence. It's <span class="casual">design</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                And that's what this whole project is: making that design visible. Not to prove anything to anyone.
                Not to convert people or start arguments. Just to show what's there.
            </p>

            <div class="divider">✦ ✦ ✦</div>

            <h2>What This Taught Me</h2>
            <p>
                Building this changed how I see the Bible. I didn't expect that. I thought I was just making
                a cool visualization tool. But when you spend hundreds of hours in the text, following
                connections, seeing patterns... something shifts.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Old Testament and New Testament aren't two separate books. They're one story. Every page
                in the NT is soaked in OT references. Over <span class="stats-inline">60,000 cross-testament
                connections</span>. That's not an accident.
            </p>
            <p>
                The unity is undeniable. 66 books, written over 1,500 years by 40+ different authors, and it
                all fits together like a tapestry. You can see it in the data.
            </p>

            <h2>I'm Not Asking You to Believe Anything</h2>
            <p>
                You don't have to be religious to use this. You don't have to believe in God. You don't have to
                agree with anything I've said here.
            </p>
            <p>
                All I'm asking is that you <em>look</em>. Look at the data. Look at the connections. See the pattern
                for yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
                Maybe you'll see what I see. Maybe you won't. But at least you'll know it's there.
            </p>

            <div class="divider">✦ ✦ ✦</div>

            <h2>The Hotel Room Book</h2>
            <p>
                That Bible sitting in hotel nightstands? The one everyone jokes about but nobody reads?
                That book has <span class="stats-inline">340,000+ internal cross-references</span>. It maps itself.
                Every verse points to other verses. It's self-documenting, self-referential, interconnected
                across thousands of years.
            </p>
            <p>
                And people just... ignore it. They dismiss it as old mythology or outdated rules.
            </p>
            <p>
                But what if they could <em>see</em> it differently? What if instead of a dusty book, they saw
                a weapon? A tool? A map?
            </p>
            <p>
                That's why I built this. Not to shove religion down anyone's throat. But to show them what
                they're missing when they write it off.
            </p>

            <h2>To My Irish Catholic Roots</h2>
            <p>
                My parents gave me something when they sent me to Catholic school. At the time, I didn't
                appreciate it. Mass felt long. The prayers felt repetitive. The stories felt... old.
            </p>
            <p>
                But it planted something in me. A foundation. A framework. Even now, even without going
                to church every week, I think about Christ. I think about how He'd want me to live.
                I think about grace, forgiveness, sacrifice.
            </p>
            <p>
                Maybe that Irish Catholic upbringing is why I see the Bible differently. Not as a rulebook.
                Not as ancient history. But as something <span class="casual">living</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                So this is, in a way, my thanks to them. To my parents. To the nuns and priests who taught me.
                To the tradition that shaped me, even when I didn't realize it was happening.
            </p>

            <h2>Why "Get Proselytized"?</h2>
            <p>
                The name is a little cheeky, I know. But it's honest.
            </p>
            <p>
                I want you to get proselytized by the <em>data</em>. Not by me. Not by religion. By the
                connections themselves. By seeing how it all fits together in ways you can't unsee.
            </p>
            <p>
                Call it what you want—design, coincidence, divine inspiration. All I know is it's there.
                And once you see it, you can't ignore it.
            </p>

            <div class="divider">✦ ✦ ✦</div>

            <h2>A Note to You</h2>
            <p>
                I don't know who you are or why you're reading this. Maybe you stumbled here by accident.
                Maybe you're curious. Maybe you're skeptical. That's okay.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm not here to convince you of anything. I'm not trying to convert you. I'm just showing
                you what I found when I looked closer at that "stupid old silly book" everyone dismisses.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you see it, great. If you don't, that's fine too. But at least now you know someone
                looked at the data and saw something worth sharing.
            </p>
